Description: Methods to categorize ICD-9-CM and ICD-10 codes into sensible
    disease categories have been developed and published by numerous authors.
    Two of the most widely used such methods are the Deyo adaptation of the
    Charlson index and the Elixhauser index. This package has functions to
    categorize comorbidites into the Deyo-Charlson index, the original
    Elixhauser index of 30 comorbidities, and the AHRQ comorbidity index of 29
    diagnoses (an update to the original Elixhauser method). This package
    builds upon the work of Paul Gerrard and his comorbidities package.
