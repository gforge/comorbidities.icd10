NEWS for the Gmisc package

Changes for 0.4
---------------
* Externalized hierarchy and points calculator
* Added the main cmrbdt.calc() function
* Added a dot preprocessor
* Expanded the tests

Changes for 0.3
---------------
* Started implementing regular expression alternatives for elixhauser and charlson scores
* Refactored use in order to optimize the use of vectors with icdCodes for a single individual. 
* The original NA handling from the comorbidities package is now changed so that the missing codes are simply skipped - should have significant performance improvements
* Renamed the functions to lower-case in for package consistency
* Externalized numeric and regular expression functions as these may be of interest to users and renamed them to codefinder.*

Changes for 0.2
---------------
* Implemented testthat tests
* Bug found in the weighting of the Charlson's Deyo index; the weights that are set to 6 are wrong, note the code below:
-  output.frame[, 16] <- output.frame[, 17] * 6
-  output.frame[, 16] <- output.frame[, 17] * 6
- both update the 16 column and not their own column
* Bug found in the Deyo aortic aneurysm group:
-  441, 441.9 does not include all 441 codes that correspond to the code according to CMS.goc ICD-9
* Bug found in the Deyo severe liver group:
-  572.3 and 572.4 cause a floating point mismatch -> Switched everyting to integers for Deyo and Elixhausers
* Bug found in the Deyo renal group: 585 is a group and not just 585.00
* Bug - use of seq(xxx.0 to xxx.9, by=0.01) will not include xxx.91 or above
* Split Elixhauser hypertension group into complicated and uncomplicated
* Switched to standard NROW/NCOL

Changes for 0.1
-------------------
* Refactored the code for the comorbidities package to better suit a package-environment
* Instead of looping through the values in each code-list the %in% is now used
* The output.frame is now based on the actual names of the groups, should limit the risk of misclassifying diseases.
* The hierarchy check is now vectorized and also applies to the deyo calculation for diabetes and malignancies
* Converted the Rd documentation to roxygen format
* Allowed for numeric icd-codes
